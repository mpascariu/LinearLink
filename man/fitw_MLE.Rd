\title{# Estimate bx, vx and k with Poisson Likelihood Method}
\source{
Brouhns et al. 2002
}
\usage{
fitw_MLE(log_ex_theta, log_mx, ...)
}
\description{
The implemented method of estimated the bx, vx and k coefficients of the 
LinearLink model is based on the approach described in Brouhns et al. 2002
for fitting the Lee-Carter model. 
Code written by Jose Manuel Aburto with minor changes by Marius Pascariu
