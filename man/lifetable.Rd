\title{Life table function}
\usage{
lifetable(x, Dx = NULL, Ex = NULL, mx = NULL, qx = NULL, lx0 = 1e+05,
  ax0 = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of ages}

\item{Dx}{Vector containing death counts. An element of the vector, Dx, 
represents the number of deaths during the year to persons aged x to x+1}

\item{Ex}{Vector containing the exposure in the period. 
Ex is the mid-year population aged x to x+1}

\item{mx}{Age-specific death rates}

\item{qx}{1-year probability of dying between age x and x+1}

\item{lx0}{Radix}

\item{ax0}{average time spent between age 0 and age 1 of those how died 
in age 0. For x > 0 we assume a uniform distribution of deaths (UDD).}

Life Tables

\description{
Function to create a life table with input variables: (age, Dx, Ex) 
or (age, mx) or (age, qx)

ages <- as.numeric(rownames(F_mx))
year <- 1970
mx <- F_mx[, paste(year)]
